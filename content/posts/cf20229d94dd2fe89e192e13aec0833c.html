<p><span class="wpcom_tag_link">Omnipotent</span>，臭名昭著的<span class="wpcom_tag_link">RaidForums</span>的前任管理员，今天发布了一条带有PGP签名的声明，PGP签名的存在基本证实了也许确实是他自己发布的。声明的大概内容是：”你们都是好人，看到pom因经营自己的Raidforums后继者BreachForums而遭受打击，以及他自杀，我很难过。我也处在这个相同的位置。在这些时候，也请大家支持其他受害者。我现在没有任何重启Raidforums的计划，不能为其他人担保。我也对Raidforums的数据库泄露感到非常震惊。不知道它是如何发生的。它是有效的，可以追溯到2020年底。据我所知，没有工作人员从raidforums被捕。“</p>
<p>这是一条有趣的声明，有点意味深长，<mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">“暗网下/AWX”</mark>详细描述该声明，建议大家阅读。</p>
<p>Omnipotent是现在已经被FBI捣毁的Raidforums背后的所有者，今天突然给他的网站（rf.to）提供了一个带签名的更新声明。所有人可以在其网站查看：<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rf.to/statement-1.txt" target="_blank">https://rf.to/statement-1.txt</a>，打开该网址：<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rf.to/statements" target="_blank">https://rf.to/statements</a>，可以阅读所有其他声明。</p>
<p>在声明中，他首先表示，要感谢“每一位向我伸出援手，传递善意和支持的信息”的用户。有些人“甚至每天都与我联系并保持友好的交谈”，并从心底里感谢他们。</p>
<p>第2点，他说了一些关于“pompompurin”和他经营自己的BreachForums的事情，他说：“得知他所谓的自杀企图，我很痛苦，我想告诉他坚持住，我也发现自己处于同样的困境。有一部分的我背负着罪恶感，特别是当我考虑到那些可能觉得有必要继续我的遗产的人，后来又面临着正是这样做的后果。不管怎么样，我还是要感谢我们社区的成员，他们挺身而出，填补了RaidForums离开后留下的空白，创造了空间和论坛，使社区保持活力。”</p>
<p>接着，他说：”我请求你们向那些发现自己被卷入RaidForums活动的法律后果的人提供支持。现在比以往任何时候都更需要你们的同情心。我最近看到Euronews的一篇文章，详细介绍了其中一名嫌疑人的困境：<a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/06/02/raidforums-the-child-hacker-facing-extradition-to-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/06/02/raidforums-the-child-hacker-facing-extradition-to-the-us</a>，情况相当糟糕。此外，我不禁质疑当局在这件事上的一些行为背后的道德，但美国的不道德行为由来已久，所以这并不令我惊讶“。</p>
<p>对于重建RaidForums，他再次澄清，RaidForums已被FBI查封并下线，他目前没有任何建造替代品的计划。他为这个社区奉献了他生命中的重要部分，因此他希望大家能够尊重这个决定。并表示，社区中还有其他人建立了替代平台。虽然他个人不能保证它们的安全性或可靠性，但它们可供希望找到它们的人使用。</p>
<p>然后，他谈到了RaidForums数据库泄漏事件，说他不知道它是如何发生的，因为除了他自己之外，没有人被允许访问数据库。但他确认了泄漏数据库的真实性，说”泄露的数据库似乎是真实的，可以追溯到2020年底。“他从发布泄漏数据库的人那里得到的说法是，泄露数据库是由管理员Jaw通过管理面板下载的。他还抨击了ExposedForums或泄露数据的论坛，声称”他们在计划为RaidForums社区建立一个替代论坛时，居然自愿暴露自己社区的数据，我觉得信任这样的人令人深感不安和反常”。</p>
<p>最后，他陈述了关于工作人员被捕的情况，声称“有三个人因涉嫌与我们社区有关而被捕，其中两人后来被释放，等待进一步调查。第三个人目前正面临可能被引渡到美国的情况。”他还表示，”然而，我想平息任何关于Jaw、Moot或任何其他工作人员是否被逮捕的猜测——他们没有”。</p>

This is a PGP signed message from Omnipotent;

First and foremost, I want to express gratitude to every one of you who has reached out to me, bearing messages of goodwill and support. Some have even contacted me daily and kept friendly chatter flowing, I thank you for this much needed distraction. To those of you offering this outpouring of support—you know who you are—I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Secondly, I feel compelled to address the situation surrounding pompompurin. I've briefly touched on this in a past message on Pastebin, but given the gravity of the matter, it warrants more than a fleeting mention here. It's come to my attention that yes, pompompurin started a website to replace RaidForums and he was quickly thereafter arrested by the FBI and is now facing charges. It pains me to learn of his alleged suicide attempt, and I want to tell him to hold on, I too have found myself in the same boat. There's a part of me that carries a burden of guilt, especially when I consider those who may feel the need to continue my legacy and later face the repercussions of doing exactly that. Regardless of this, I'd still like to thank the members of our community who've stepped up to fill the void left by RaidForums' departure, creating spaces and forums to keep the community alive.

I ask that you offer your support to those who've found themselves involved in the legal aftermath of RaidForums' activities. Your compassion is needed now more than ever. I recently came across an article by Euronews detailing the plight of one of the suspects https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/06/02/raidforums-the-child-hacker-facing-extradition-to-the-us, and the situation is quite bad. Moreover, I can't help but question the ethics behind some of the authorities' actions in this matter, but the USA has a long history of immoral actions so it doesn't surprise me.

FAQ:
On the topic of RaidForums' accessibility and possible re-establishment:
    Many of you have reached out to me in a state of confusion, seeking access to RaidForums as if it were still active. I need to clarify once again that RaidForums was seized and taken offline by the FBI. I don't have any current plans to build a replacement. I've dedicated a significant portion of my life to this community, and I hope you respect my decision. However, there are others within the community who have set up alternative platforms. While I can't vouch for their safety or reliability personally, they're available for those who wish to find them.

Concerning the recent RaidForums database leak:
    The leak was quite surprising to me as no one was ever granted access to the database aside from myself. A few possibilities spring to mind: a previously unnoticed exploit, a temporary administrative permissions oversight allowing for a backup download, or perhaps involvement from federal agencies. I engaged in a conversation with the individual who posted the leak, and it seemed their story was that the database was downloaded via the admin panel by the admin Jaw—something that should have been impossible. However, I take this information with a grain of skepticism. Thankfully, IPs were removed from the publicly leaked data, and the master encryption password for the hashes wasn't included, meaning no passwords were compromised, if the leaker's story is true then it means the master password is not under the posession of whomever was the original source of this leak. Nonetheless, it's a regrettable situation, particularly for those users who may have been lax with their opsec during registration. As for the individual who caused the leak—I find it deeply troubling and counterintuitive to trust such a person, considering they willingly exposed their own community's data when they were planning on building a replacement forum for RaidForums' community. For the record, the leaked database appears to be authentic and dates back to late 2020.

Regarding the arrest of staff members:
    To the best of my understanding, three individuals have been arrested in alleged connection with our community, two of whom have since been released pending further investigation. The third is currently facing possible extradition to the US. For obvious reasons, I can't provide further details. However, I would like to put to rest any speculation about whether Jaw, Moot, or any other staff members have been arrested—they have not.

Godspeed to you all.
